After that forkbomb charade, I don't think you'd let me touch your computer anymore.
I guess I'm leaving now...
I would like to thank my mom, dad, my third furthest cousin Bob, and that ASCII symbol over there on the right of the screen.
*sniff* I wish it didn't have to end this way...
No, it's not you, it's me.
Goodbye, good Linux user...


(and say goodbye to your files as well MUAHAHAHAHA)
