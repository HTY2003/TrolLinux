# TrolLinux
A Linux virus that trolls you

Suicide Linux is a linux distro/package that deletes all your files when you mistype a command. What if I did that, but tak eit WAYYY further?

How to Use
-----------
1. Put run.sh in your home folder
2. Put all the other files in a folder called 'beta'
3. Put 'beta' in your home folder.
4. Enter 'bash run.sh' in your terminal. The folder will be moved to a secret location, and the magic will begin :)

Notes
------
The forkbomb and file removal commands are commented out to prevent um...accidents. You can find them and uncomment in hell_world.py.
